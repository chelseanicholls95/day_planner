# Day Planner

## Description

The aim of this project was to create a work day planner that the user can input and saves their tasks for the day. When refreshed, the day's tasks will remain on the page. The project uses jQuery as well as Moment.js to get the current date and time which determines what colour the time blocks are based on if it is in the past, present or future. Bootstrap has also been used to style the page.
